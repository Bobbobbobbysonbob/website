please dont steal my work and credit yourself and if you do just so you know your ruining your reputiation and not doing anything for the world so how about you go outside get a job and make a living off of yourself, you can make it, I believe in you. Now go out there, and
show the world who you really are, don't just steal other peoples work, it won't get you anywhere.
